# Challenge 3: JavaScript Password Generator

I was given a starter code and tasked with fixing up the code to be able to generate a random password with given criteria. First, prompts were supposed to appear that enabled the user to determine which criteria that they wanted to include in their random password that would be generated. Then, I had to create a for loop and if statements that would help the function run and create the random password with the predetermined criteria.
